Welcome everyone,

My name is Midhun. I'm a CSE graduate currently working in an automation based testing company called Headspin.

I'm trying to develop a set of automation scripts which we can use in our day to day lives.
Basically I'm trying to develop selenium scripts using python to manage alerts.

This is my first attempt. For that, I have chose BookMyShow.
I'm a movie enthusiast. I have a crave for first day shows.
Usually around the time a movie releases, I have to check BMS app every 10 minutes to look whether the bookings have been started.
I got tired of that. BMS app dont have an alert system, which is a good thing or else it will give everyone an equal chance to nab best seats.

But as a matter of fact, I thought it will be nice if someone else will do this random checking for me.
Thats why I have developed this.

I haven't got the chance to test this completely.
But I have managed to solve almost every possibilities there.

If anyone manage to find this, please help me perfecting this script.
